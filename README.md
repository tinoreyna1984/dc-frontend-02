## Overview

![screenshot](./public/screenshot.png)

Since I have been working with React and Next.js, I wanted to try a bit more of excercising the concepts of a functional class, reusability and a deep understanding of some logic combinations to achieve this challenge. The screenshot shows the as-is aspects of all custom inputs, so you can check out by clicking or hovering on any of these inputs to see that satisfies the design from the Figma file.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/): CSS with superpowers
